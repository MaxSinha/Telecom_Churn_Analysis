What is Customer Churn?

Customer churn is defined as when customers or subscribers discontinue doing business with a firm or service.

Customers in the telecom industry can choose from a variety of service providers and actively switch from one to the next. The telecommunications business has an annual churn rate of 15-25 percent in this highly competitive market.

Individualized customer retention is tough because most firms have a large number of customers and can't afford to devote much time to each of them. The costs would be too great, outweighing the additional revenue. However, if a corporation could forecast which customers are likely to leave ahead of time, it could focus customer retention efforts only on these "high-risk" clients. The ultimate goal is to expand its coverage area and retrieve more customer loyalty. The core to success in this market lies in the customer itself.

Customer churn is a critical metric because it is much less expensive to retain existing customers than it is to acquire new customers.


To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

To detect early signs of potential churn, one must first develop a holistic view of the customers and their interactions across numerous channels, including store/branch visits, product purchase histories, customer service calls, Web-based transactions, and social media interactions, to mention a few.

As a result, by addressing churn, these businesses may not only preserve their market position but also grow and thrive. The more customers they have in their network, the lower the cost of initiation and the larger the profit. As a result, the company's key focus for success is reducing client attrition and implementing an effective retention strategy.

Objectives I will explore the data and try to answer some questions like:

What's the % of Churn Customers and customers that keep in with the active services?
Are there any patterns in Churn Customers based on gender?
Are there any patterns/preferences in Churn Customers based on the type of service provided?
What are the most profitable service types?
Which features and services are most profitable?
Many more questions that will arise during the analysis
Project Summary -
Telecom Churn Analysis and Prediction

The Telecom Churn Analysis and Prediction project delves into a dataset containing customer attributes and churn status within the telecommunications industry. Its primary objective is to analyze key insights and patterns to understand customer behavior and predict churn.

The project begins with a comprehensive exploration of the dataset, comprising customer characteristics such as gender, tenure, services subscribed, payment methods, and churn status. Notably, the data exhibits high quality, with minimal missing values.

Insights gleaned from the analysis shed light on various aspects, including customer tenure and its correlation with churn, the impact of monthly charges on churn rates, and the significance of certain features in predicting churn.

To address the challenge of imbalanced data, the project employs advanced machine learning techniques, training, and evaluating multiple classifiers. The Random Forest Classifier using SMOTEENN emerges as the top-performing model, achieving an accuracy of 93.16% and demonstrating notable improvements in the recall, precision, and F1-score for churned customers.

Looking ahead, the project underscores the significance of its findings for strategic decision-making in customer retention and churn reduction efforts within the telecommunications sector. It emphasizes the potential for real-time churn prediction and proactive intervention strategies to enhance customer loyalty and drive sustainable growth.

In conclusion, the Telecom Churn Analysis and Prediction project offers valuable insights and predictive capabilities to empower telecommunications companies in optimizing operations, enhancing customer satisfaction, and fostering competitiveness in the marketplace.
